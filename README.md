# ConcertLife App ðŸŽ¤

This app helps you to find the concerts in your city, helps you to remember them and gives you an overview about your concert history.

This App is the capstone-project of my web development bootcamp @neuefische and is optimized for mobile usage only.

Stay tuned to see the development within the next weeks ðŸ’»
